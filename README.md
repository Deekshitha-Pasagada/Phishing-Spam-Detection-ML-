# Phishing-Spam-Detection-ML-
Phishing detection system that extracts URL-based features and applies classical ML models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, XGBoost) to classify sites as legitimate or phishing. The repository includes clean notebooks, a saved model artifact, and a simple Flask web interface for quick demos.
